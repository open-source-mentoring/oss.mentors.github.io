[Open Source Mentoring] knows a lot about the tech industry and programming. 
This allows him to help you both with goal-setting and planning, 
as well as just getting individual projects done. In my case,
his assistance was vital for my first major personal coding project 
that I later ended up getting an academic award for. He offers
insightful and tailor-made advice that helps you with
your own personal needs and interests, and he is also
caring, thoughtful and just fun to work with.
