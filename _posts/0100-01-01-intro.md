## Enabling Early Stage Engineers

We enable you to bridge the gap between industry and school by building
real experience that industry values. Open Source Mentoring was founded
by employees at leading tech companies who have successfully mentored
students and interns who got jobs at companies like Twitter and Amazon out of college.

**Let us help you grow into an amazing career!**
